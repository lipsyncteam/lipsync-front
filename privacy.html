            <p>This Privacy Policy covers the LipSync application (hereinafter “Application”) and LipSync.io website (hereinafter “Website”), which are owned and operated by LipSync, Inc. (“LipSync”).  LipSync is committed to protecting the privacy of its users and wishes to maintain a safe and secure environment for all users of the Application and Website.  Please read the following Privacy Policy to understand how your personal information is treated.  From time to time, LipSync may offer new services and/or products that may require LipSync to update this Privacy Policy.  Please check back with us periodically.  If you have questions or concerns regarding this policy, you should contact LipSync’s Privacy Administrator by email at <a href="mailto:info@lipsync.io">info@lipsync.io</a></p>

            <p>This Privacy Policy answers the following questions for you regarding your privacy protection:</p>

            <h2>WHAT INFORMATION DOES LIPSYNC COLLECT?</h2>

            <p>LipSync collects personal information from users for different purposes.  Information gathered can be identified as either anonymous or identifiable.  Anonymous information is information that cannot be traced back to the individual.  Identifiable information is information that is specific to an individual.</p>

            <h3>Anonymous Information</h3>

            <p>Like many applications and websites, the Application and Website gathers certain information automatically and stores it.  This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser types, Internet services providers (ISP), referring/exit pages, date/time stamps, and clickstream data.  LipSync uses this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, administer the Application and Website, gather demographic information about its user base as a whole, and improve its level of service to you.  LipSync does not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.</p>

            <h3>Personally Identifiable Information</h3>

            <p>To use the Application and Website, a user must register for an account.  A user may register by creating an account through the Application or Website.  In either case, LipSync will collect the following information: (i) name, (ii) email address, and (iii) password.  Alternatively, LipSync may allow a user to register using Facebook to authenticate the user’s identity.  If a user registers using Facebook, Facebook will ask permission to share certain information from the user’s Facebook account with LipSync.  In addition, users must provide financial information in order to use the LipSync service.  However, all financial information is processed through third-party payment processors, such as Stripe, and LipSync does not collect or store a user’s financial information.  The provision of this personal information is mandatory and if you choose not to submit the requested information we will not be able to provide you with an account.</p>

            <p>LipSync also collects various information related to the calls that a user places through the Application or Website.  Such information may include the duration of the call, the date and time of the call, the number called, and the identity of the interpreter used on the call.</p>

            <h2>DOES THE APPLICATION OR WEBSITE USE "COOKIES"?</h2>

            <p>Yes, the Application and Website use cookies.  A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user’s device to help us improve your access to the Application or Website and identify repeat visitors.  Cookies can also enable LipSync to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience.  Cookies are not linked to any personally identifiable information.</p>

            <h2>HOW DOES LIPSYNC USE MY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?</h2>

            <p>Personally identifiable information collected is used primarily for the purpose it is collected (e.g., creating a user account).  LipSync also may use a user’s email address as follows provided that the user grants his/her consent to such additional use:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>in internal surveys to obtain feedback on aspects of LipSync’s business; </li>
                <li>to notify users of information LipSync thinks may be of interest to them; </li>
                <li>to send communications or promotional materials. </li>
            </ul>

            <p>LipSync may also use personal information collected to contact users in connection with the inappropriate use of the Application or Website.</p>

            <h2>DOES LIPSYNC DISCLOSE MY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?</h2>

            <p>From time to time, LipSync may disclose your personal information to organizations that perform services for or on behalf of LipSync, for example to provide customer service, for research, marketing, data processing, and to measure the use of our Application or Website.  LipSync will share with these companies only that personal information which they need to work on our behalf.  Some of these service providers may be located in other countries.  Your personal information will be provided to these organizations only if they agree to use such information solely for the purpose of providing services to LipSync, and under the instructions of LipSync, and with respect to that information, to act in a manner consistent with the relevant principles articulated in this Privacy Policy. </p>

            <h2>IS MY PERSONAL INFORMATION SECURE?</h2>

            <p>The Application and Website has security measures in place to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information that we obtain from you, but we make no assurances about LipSync’s ability to prevent any such loss, misuse, or alteration to you or to any third party.  Please review LipSync’s Terms of Service regarding LipSync’s liability for any loss, misuse, or alteration of personally identifiable information.</p>

            <h2>CAN I UPDATE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT ME?</h2>

            <p>You have the right to correct and update the personal information collected about you through the Application or Website.  You can make changes to your personal information at any time by logging into your account.  You will need your email address and password in order to access your account.</p>

            <h2>WILL YOU NOTIFY ME IN THE EVENT OF CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY?</h2>

            <p>LipSync reserves the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy.  In the event of a material change in our information collection and handling practices, LipSync will inform those users who have provided an email address via email.  Any changes will apply prospectively only.</p>

            <h2>HOW CAN I OPT-OUT FROM RECEIVING EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS?</h2>

            <p>LipSync provides you the opportunity to “opt-out” of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes when we ask for this information.  For example, if you register for an account but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference during the account creation process.  If you opted-in to receive marketing communications but no longer wish to receive communications from us, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each communication.</p>

            <h2>LINKS</h2>

            <p>The Application or Website may contain links to other applications or websites.  Please be aware that LipSync is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other applications or websites.  LipSync encourages users to read the privacy policies of each and every application and website that collects personally identifiable information.  This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by LipSync.</p>

            <h2>NOTICE REGARDING CHILDREN</h2>

            <p>The Application and Website is general audience app and does not direct any of its content specifically at children under 13 years of age.  We understand and are committed to respecting the sensitive nature of children’s privacy.  If we learn or have reason to suspect that a user is under age 13, we will promptly delete any personal information in that user’s account.</p>

            <h2>INTERNATIONAL USERS</h2>

            <p>LipSync is a U.S. company and the Application and Website is hosted in the United States.  If you access the Website from the European Union, Asia, or any other region, country, or jurisdiction with privacy laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure that differ from United States privacy laws, please note that, by your continued use of the Application and Website, you are transferring your personal information to the United States and you consent to that transfer.  In addition, you understand that your personal information may be processed in countries (including the United States) where privacy laws may be less stringent than in your country.</p>
